          When you say Black hat, youre probably referring to hacking for
          offensive or illegal purposes—breaking into systems, stealing data,
          etc. I know the urge can come from wanting justice, revenge, or simply
          proving that youre better than those gatekeepers. Its a form of
          rebellion. But heres the truth: Black hat paths lead to isolation,
          legal problems, and short-term satisfaction at best. And most
          importantly: they won’t help you build the Somali tech community or
          inspire others.
